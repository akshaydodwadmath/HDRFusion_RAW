# HDRFusion_RAW

Matlab based merging of multiple RAW images to a single HDR image. Use the command line to run the main program with the input as the folder containing the LDR RAW images.

```
main('folder_name')
```

A single HDR image in .hdr format is generated as output.

Note: DCRaw is required to read RAW images within MATLAB, you might need to install as documented here https://gitlab.com/astrophotography/matlab-readraw.
